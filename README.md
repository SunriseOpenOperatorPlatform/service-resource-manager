# Service Resource Manager
<br>
The Service Resource Manager (SRM) is a web service written in Python and and based on the Flask micro we framework. It implements the Service Resource manager role of the Operator Platform, defined by the  [GSMA Operator Platform Group (OPG)](https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/technologies/networks/gsma_resources/gsma-operator-platform-group-september-2024-publications/)

## Description
<br>
The Service Resource Manager facilitates the North-South Bound Interface (NSBI) specification of GSMA, by acting as an interconenction link between the CAMARA-defined API exposed by the Open Exposure Gateway, and the transformation functions that expose the underlying infrastructure techology. Since a principal goal of the SUNRISE6G Operator Platform is the exposure of diverse technology stacks, SRM seamlessly handles the Application Provider's request for infrastructure access by selecting the appropriate transformation function.
